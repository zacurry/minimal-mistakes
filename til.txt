As as a general rule processes running without root privileges cannot bind to ports below 1024

Check if a process is running :

ps aux | grep server.js

$ ps aux

USER = user owning the process
PID = process ID of the process
%CPU = It is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running.
%MEM = ratio of the processâ€™s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine
VSZ = virtual memory usage of entire process (in KiB)
RSS = resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in KiB)
TTY = controlling tty (terminal)
STAT = multi-character process state
START = starting time or date of the process
TIME = cumulative CPU time
COMMAND = command with all its arguments

I spent several years looking to quit programming and found it: I'm a finance/biz analyst.

It's a big move and has big consequences:
Programmers are intellectually superior to other professionals. When a programmer moves to another job, he/she becomes the smartest guy in the room.
This is both a pro and a con depending on your character. I fucking hate it.
Programmers are lazy and entitled. 
If your'e still reading, I mean it relatively. Try working in a restaurant "back end", i.e. the kitchen/loading bay/supply van, and witness the other end of employer-employee relations spectrum. Financial analysis is closer to a kitchen than to engineering, you get micro-tasks to be performed immediately.
I code more than before, but I code for myself and don't check-in anything. I don't even have CVS anymore. This difference alone takes 90% of the stress out.
Programmers' professional integrity is impeccable, which is not required at all in finance and can even be a problem. The first time it came to me as a shock when boss asked me to calculate something and said the result "should be X". I thought only "public sector" "economists" do that. Turns out big companies are all politics and whose managers fight each other by asking analysts to cook the numbers. It made me throw up but after recouping my cynicism I learned to like it, it feels like I'm an evil wizard who can turn a prince into a frog.
Programmers are respected, analysts are not. This manifests in the people who manage them. 
When companies hire dev-managers they try very hard (and still fail most of the time). Good companies let teams interview their prospective bosses.
In finance, any schmuck can be your boss. A politicking parrot with MBA in cocksucking can manage a team of mathematicians or ex-programmers.
Remember the retarded fuck who paid you to do his university chores cause he's too stupid and lazy? he's your boss now, the investment has paid off.
The uber-difference: work ends at 6 PM and nothing is carried over. When you get home your'e a free man just like the restaurant worker. Nobody expects you to fix bugs at midnight. Sloppy work doesn't get back at you, It's a miracle if anyone can even tell when you slack.
In engineering, you operate under the force of inevitability. Everything you do must be done, and correctly. Slack one line of code and it'll get back at you. Slack a class and more code needs to be rewritten. Slack a design and the whole thing needs refactoring. Any slacking is turned against you, with due interest. That totally sucks.
In "business" the force of who-fucking-cares-lol holds supreme. Numbers are subjective. Logic is a personal perspective. Do what you want as long as you say the right things (gracefully dictated by your bosses).
Summary: switching from programming to finance takes off 30% of income, 90% of respect and "status", and 100% of stress and commitment.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24353778/which-is-best-data-type-for-phone-number-in-mysql-and-what-should-java-type-mapp :

In MySQL -> INT(10) does not mean a 10-digit number, it means an integer with a display width of 10 digits. The maximum value for an INT in MySQL is 2147483647 (or 4294967295 if unsigned).

You can use a BIGINT instead of INT to store it as a numeric. Using BIGINT will save you 3 bytes per row over VARCHAR(10).
