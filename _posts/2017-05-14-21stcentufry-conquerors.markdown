** 21st centure conquerors **

The central theme in the madieval ages were the competition between the european nations.

It witnessed colonialization of natives , assimilation of cultures and the visitors enriching themselves.

The corporates have replaced the nations. Uber is the spanish armada. And google is the christian missionary.

Democracy, free trade, trickle down economics , freedom are the new bible.
