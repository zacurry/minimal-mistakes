After years of doing nothing, I decided to do climb  out of my pit and do something. I decided I needed a move, and german seemed an interesting and challenging means to an end. It turned out a weekend german class was starting at the goethe zentrum nearby, and I registered. This was 3 months back.
It was fun and overall nice. One pleasant surprise was that it helpled me improve my knowledge of english grammar - eexotic terms like adverbs, propsitions, nominative, accusative were thrown at me by my German intructor. It created difficulties in the beginning but am glad that he did. I have always wanted to learn all these stuff. Hopefully it will help me better my error riddled writing also. I have never written anything in my life before this blog.


Weekend classes are difficult for language learning if you neglect it completely during the weekdays. Having to work on a new technology at work didn't help.
Also not helping was an unhealthy interest in bitcoin and encryption - which I caught around the same time.

So , why am I talking about german now ? My beginner level german proficiency test is coming up this week. And I have a lot to cover. Hopefully it turns out good.
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
**Resolutions for the week**

1. Have fun.
