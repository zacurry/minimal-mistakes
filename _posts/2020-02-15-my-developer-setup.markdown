Quite a few of my friends have asked me about my dev set up, so here goes - (amazon affiliate links included)

I have 2 laptops - for work and personal use. I use the same keyboard for both and switch seamlessly between them using a [multi device bluetooth keyboard and mouse from logitech](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01NAVO5PF/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B01NAVO5PF&linkCode=as2&tag=zacstore-21&linkId=562ed074b48bba4fedb6b9243d797bf6).

Sometimes I need to work and cloud IDEs where the menu takes up most the screen . The [Benq monitor](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B073NTCT4R/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B073NTCT4R&linkCode=as2&tag=zacstore-21&linkId=c85d85194ae383ac479c18ef3af6ec16) is for times like this. And also for watching seinfeld.
